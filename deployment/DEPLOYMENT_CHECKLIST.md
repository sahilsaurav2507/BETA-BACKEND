## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Guide

### **Common Issues**

#### **Services Not Starting**
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs

# Check disk space
df -h

# Check memory
free -h

# Restart services
docker-compose restart
```

#### **SSL Issues**
```bash
# Check certificate files
ls -la nginx/ssl/

# Test SSL
openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443

# Renew certificates
sudo certbot renew --force-renewal
./ssl-renew.sh
```

#### **Email Not Sending**
```bash
# Check SMTP configuration
docker-compose exec backend python -c "
from app.core.config import settings
print(f'SMTP: {settings.SMTP_SERVER}:{settings.SMTP_PORT}')
"

# Check email processor
docker-compose logs backend | grep email

# Test SMTP connection
telnet smtp.gmail.com 587
```

#### **Database Issues**
```bash
# Check MySQL logs
docker-compose logs mysql

# Test connection
docker-compose exec mysql mysql -u root -p

# Check database size
docker-compose exec mysql mysql -u root -p -e "
SELECT table_schema AS 'Database',
ROUND(SUM(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS 'Size (MB)'
FROM information_schema.tables
GROUP BY table_schema;
"
```
