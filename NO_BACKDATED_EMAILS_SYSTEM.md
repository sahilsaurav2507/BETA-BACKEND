# 🚫 No Backdated Emails System

## 🎯 **System Overview**

The LawVriksh Email Campaign System now implements **smart email scheduling** that prevents new users from receiving emails for campaigns that have already passed their scheduled dates.

### **Key Principle:**
**New users should only receive emails for future events, never for past events.**

## 📅 **How It Works**

### **Current Campaign Schedule (All Future):**
Since we're currently in **July 2025**, all campaigns are still in the future:

| Mail | Schedule | Status | New Users Will Receive |
|------|----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Mail 1** | **Instant** | ✅ **Always Active** | ✅ **YES** - Sent immediately |
| **Mail 2** | **July 26, 2025, 2:00 PM IST** | ✅ **Future** | ✅ **YES** - Will be sent automatically |
| **Mail 3** | **July 30, 2025, 10:30 AM IST** | ✅ **Future** | ✅ **YES** - Will be sent automatically |
| **Mail 4** | **August 3, 2025, 9:00 AM IST** | ✅ **Future** | ✅ **YES** - Will be sent automatically |

### **Example Scenario (Future Date):**
If someone registers on **August 5, 2025** (after some campaigns have passed):

| Mail | Schedule | Status | New Users Will Receive |
|------|----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Mail 1** | **Instant** | ✅ **Always Active** | ✅ **YES** - Sent immediately |
| **Mail 2** | **July 26, 2025** | ❌ **Past** | ❌ **NO** - Backdated, skipped |
| **Mail 3** | **July 30, 2025** | ❌ **Past** | ❌ **NO** - Backdated, skipped |
| **Mail 4** | **August 3, 2025** | ❌ **Past** | ❌ **NO** - Backdated, skipped |

**Result**: New user gets only the welcome email, no backdated campaign emails.

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Past/Future Detection**
```python
def is_campaign_in_past(campaign_type: str) -> bool:
    """Check if a campaign's scheduled time is in the past."""
    template = EMAIL_TEMPLATES[campaign_type]
    schedule_time = template["schedule"]
    
    if schedule_time == "instant":
        return False  # Instant emails are never in the past
    
    current_time = datetime.now(IST)
    return current_time > schedule_time
```

### **2. Future Campaigns for New Users**
```python
def get_future_campaigns_for_new_user() -> list:
    """Get campaigns that should be sent to new users (only future)."""
    future_campaigns = []
    
    for campaign_type in EMAIL_TEMPLATES.keys():
        if campaign_type == "welcome":
            continue  # Welcome handled separately
        
        if not is_campaign_in_past(campaign_type):
            future_campaigns.append(campaign_type)
    
    return future_campaigns
```

### **3. Registration Flow Update**
```python
# In registration process:
# 1. Always send instant welcome email
send_welcome_email_campaign(user.email, user.name)

# 2. Log which future campaigns user will receive
future_campaigns = get_future_campaigns_for_new_user()
if future_campaigns:
    logger.info(f"User will receive {len(future_campaigns)} future campaigns")
else:
    logger.info("User registered after all campaigns - only welcome email sent")
```

### **4. Bulk Campaign Protection**
```python
def send_bulk_campaign_email(campaign_type: str, db: Session):
    """Send campaign only if it's not in the past."""
    if is_campaign_in_past(campaign_type):
        logger.warning(f"Campaign '{campaign_type}' is in the past. Skipping.")
        return 0, 0
    
    # Proceed with sending to all users
    # ...
```
